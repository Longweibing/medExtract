This project was undertaken as part of a class at The University of Iowa called Health Data Analytics.
The task was to replicate the work undertaken in a since elapsed I2B2 challenge in which medication data was
extracted from unstructured clinical text; our sytem performs comparably with some of the better performers
that emerged during that competition.

*Note: The directory "StudentData" was removed as it contained clinical text documents.
